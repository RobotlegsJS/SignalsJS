About
---

**Signals** are light-weight, strongly-typed messaging tools.
Wire your application with better APIs and less boilerplate than normal event systems.

Concept
---

* A **Signal** is essentially a mini-dispatcher specific to one event, with its own array of listeners.
* A **Signal** gives an event a concrete membership in a class.
* Listeners subscribe to real objects, not to string-based channels.
* Event string constants are no longer needed.
* **Signals** was originally implemented by [Robert Penner](https://github.com/robertpenner) in [AS3](https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals).
* **Signals** are inspired by [C# events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_syntax#Events) and [signals/slots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots) in Qt.

Syntax
---

```typescript
// with DOM EventListener
button.addEventListener("click", onClick);

// Signal equivalent; past tense is recommended
button.clicked.add(onClicked);
```
